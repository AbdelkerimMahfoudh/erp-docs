## 2026-08-05 — E.1 backup hardening · E.2 withdrawn · F0 audit
**Owner:** Claude Opus 5 (agent session)
**Heads:** docs `307c453`, `125b798`, `fcb6e93`, + this entry · backend `0940b41` · mobile `d9edbed` (unchanged — E.2 shipped no code)

### E.1 — `--hex-blob` is now mandatory

The canonical `mysqldump` command gained `--hex-blob`, keeping
`--single-transaction --routines --triggers --events --no-tablespaces`.

Every id in this database is a `BINARY(16)` UUIDv7. Without the flag those are
written as raw bytes and **the dump file is not valid UTF-8**, so any ordinary
text tool that touches it silently replaces every primary key with `U+FFFD` —
the restore then succeeds and the damage only appears later as rows that no
longer join.

Proven on `phonestore-20260805-203646.sql` (178 854 bytes):

- 0 raw `_binary` literals, 1430 `0x…` literals, whole file survives a UTF-8
  round trip (the previous dump did not).
- Original still fails for the migrator with `ERROR 1227` — the DEFINER problem
  is untouched by `--hex-blob`, which is why the sanitiser still runs.
- Sanitised copy restored as the least-privileged migrator: **48/48 tables,
  2/2 triggers byte-identical, 12 representative row counts equal, `HEX(id)`
  checksums equal, `CHECKSUM TABLE` equal across all 48 tables**, Arabic text
  and en-dashes intact.
- Audit protection still executes: `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `audit_logs` as
  `phonestore_app` both rejected with `ERROR 1644 (45000)`; 77 rows before and
  after.
- Temp database dropped, sanitised copy deleted, original never modified.

Sanitiser kept on `latin1` deliberately: legacy dumps still need byte-exact
handling, and `DEFINER=` can legitimately appear inside row data. Four new
tests cover the hex shape; 13 total, all green.

### E.2 — withdrawn: there was no BottomSheet bug

The previous session reported that `BottomSheet` never animates in on Expo web,
sitting at `translateY(720)` with the backdrop at `opacity: 0`.

**That was a measurement artifact.** In the automated browser pane
`document.visibilityState === 'hidden'` and a `requestAnimationFrame` loop
delivers **0 frames**. Reanimated drives web animations from rAF, so every
animation in the app is frozen at its initial value there — and those initial
values are exactly `screenHeight` and `0`, the two numbers reported as the bug.

An intermediate reading that appeared to show a fix was also unsound: the DOM
selector was matching an unrelated element.

**No change was shipped.** Speculative edits were reverted: the sheet is the
surface every picker, scanner and confirmation sits on, nothing was proven
broken, and there is no device or emulator here to check native behaviour
against. The false claim was removed from `docs/21`.

*Lesson worth keeping: before diagnosing an animation, confirm the page is
animating at all.*

### F0 — Users / auth / device-security audit (read-only)

No schema, API or screen touched. Written up in
[`docs/23`](docs/23_USERS_AUTH_AUDIT_AND_PLAN.md) with a dependency-ordered F1
plan in eight stages.

Headline findings:

- **Reusable and better than expected:** Argon2id throughout, rotating refresh
  tokens *with reuse detection that revokes the session*, per-device
  `auth_sessions`, permissions resolved from the database on every request (no
  roles in the JWT), and multi-branch membership with a role per branch.
- **`User` has no phone, no email and no verification state** — the OTP and
  recovery rules have nothing to attach to yet.
- **No per-user permission grant exists**, so "per-user price editing is
  Owner-delegated" is currently impossible to express.
- **`deviceId` is client-supplied, optional and never verified**, and the mobile
  client never sends it — so "new device" is not detectable today.
- **No OTP, invitation, passcode, biometric or recovery code exists at all.**
- **`login`/`logout` audit actions exist in the enum and are never written.**
- Rate limiting is per-IP only; there is no per-account lockout.
- The company auto-lock maximum **is** done (0019) and needs no rework.

### Documentation

- `docs/22` — `--hex-blob` section, revised sanitiser rationale, new drill record.
- `docs/21` — BottomSheet claim withdrawn with the evidence.
- `docs/23` — new: F0 audit + F1 plan.
- `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` — new; neither existed, and `CLAUDE.md`
  defines no handoff protocol.
