# SESSION_LOG

**Append-only. Newest entry at the top.** One entry per meaningful work session.

Never rewrite or delete an earlier entry. The single exception is correcting an
objective factual error, which must be marked inline as **CORRECTION** with the
date and the account that made it — never by silently editing the original text.

Do not paste large diffs, complete logs, secret values or customer data here.

## 2026-08-06 00:05–01:40 UTC — CLAUDE-A (emergency takeover)

- **Starting state:** Authorised takeover from CLAUDE-B, which hit its five-hour
  limit mid-implementation. Verified after `git fetch`: backend `a7ff563`,
  mobile `2e63aa8`, docs `8115067`, all level with `origin`; migration `0021`
  applied; `prisma migrate status` clean; 18 permissions with `price.edit`
  mapped to Owner only; **0** rows in `user_branch_permissions`; the pre-`0021`
  backup on disk. CLAUDE-B's handoff was **interrupted** — still
  `IN_PROGRESS / CLAUDE-B`, and its "in progress" section was stale (it called
  Stage 2 blocked at the audit gate, while `cfa2dc8` and `a7ff563` show the gate
  resolved and the core landed).
  **Discrepancy against the takeover brief:** it listed two uncommitted files;
  there were **three**. Mobile `lib/permissions.ts` was also modified (adding
  `price.edit` to the client catalogue). Coherent with the backend, so it was
  preserved, not reverted. Every other stated fact verified exactly.
  The backend tree **did not compile** at takeover: `user-management.service.ts`
  imported `./dto/grant.dto`, which did not exist.
- **Authorised task:** finish F1 Stage 2 — deployment-only `price.edit`
  correction, grant/revoke API, regression tests, Owner Team control.
- **Work completed:**
  - Took ownership in the handoff before touching anything else.
  - **Deployment gap (`0022`).** `0021` created the delegation table, but the
    `price.edit` **row** is reference data and `migrate deploy` never runs the
    seed — the same hole D2.1 fixed for store roles. New migration, guarded on
    the stable KEY (the dev database already held a hand-generated id), Owner
    only. `0021` was **not** edited. Drift tests extended so SQL and TypeScript
    cannot diverge.
  - **Grant/revoke API.** Finished CLAUDE-B's edit rather than rewriting it; its
    direction was right. Dropped only the speculative `GrantDto` import — the
    shipped contract names the authority in the route path, so there is no body
    field a client could put `discount.override` into.
  - **Regression tests**: a new delegation spec, plus the Owner/fail-closed/
    next-request cases the resolver spec was missing.
  - **Mobile**: one switch per managed branch, EN/AR, RTL-safe, confirmation,
    409/403/offline handling, prefix query invalidation.
  - Verified the mobile cold-start path still works after the no-branch
    hardening: permissions are only requested once a branch exists, and the
    Owner keeps company-scoped permissions without one.
- **Decisions made by the user:** authorised the takeover; authorised finishing
  Stage 2; forbade starting Stage 3, OTP/WhatsApp, invitations, passcodes,
  actual price editing, below-cost delegation, seats, technician, Returns/Loans/
  Consignment.
- **Files changed:** backend — `prisma/migrations/0022_price_edit_permission_backfill/`,
  `src/rbac/role-matrix-drift.spec.ts`, `src/rbac/access.service.spec.ts`,
  `src/users/user-management.service.ts`, `src/users/users.controller.ts`,
  `src/users/user-management.service.spec.ts`, `src/users/price-edit-delegation.spec.ts` (new),
  `src/common/tenant/tenant-context.service.ts`. Mobile — `app/team.tsx`,
  `types/api.ts`, `lib/i18n/{en,ar}.ts`, `lib/permissions.ts`. Docs — `docs/23`,
  `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`.
- **Database migrations:** `0022_price_edit_permission_backfill` applied to the
  shared database (a no-op there by design — `price.edit` already existed).
  Backup taken first: `~/erp-backups/phonestore-20260806-005021.sql`
  (186 087 bytes, `--hex-blob`, 0 raw `_binary`, 1479 hex literals, valid UTF-8,
  trailer present).
- **Tests and results:** **34 suites / 327 tests passing.** Backend and mobile
  `tsc` clean; `expo lint` clean; `prisma migrate status` clean, 21 migrations.
  Migration-only deploy proven on a temp database restored from the pre-`0021`
  backup via the DEFINER-safe path: no seed, `0021` table with `CASCADE`,
  `0022` `price.edit` on every Owner and nobody else, per-role counts identical
  to the seeded database, rerunning the SQL twice changed nothing.
- **Live verification:** Owner grant/revoke 200 and idempotent; the manager's
  branch-A permission set changed by **exactly one key** on the next request
  with the same token; branch B and the no-branch path unaffected; non-Owner and
  Store-Employee calls 403; granting to an employee assignment 409; forged
  branch, non-uuid branch and unknown user all 404; `discount.override` still
  Owner-only. Temporary `f1probe` fixture and `prisma_f1_deploy` database both
  removed; users back to 6, assignments to 11, grants to 0; no financial or
  inventory record touched. **3 append-only `audit_logs` rows** remain from the
  grant/revoke tests (total 88) — legitimate records of real operations.
- **Commits:** backend `0b6cbd9` (0022 + drift tests), `7047c93` (API + tests) ·
  mobile `80bc285` (Team control) · documentation: *current HEAD contains this
  handoff*.
- **Push status:** all three pushed to `origin/master` and level with their
  remotes.
- **Remaining work:** none for this task. Real-device checks (camera, haptics,
  Arabic RTL end-to-end, receipt sharing, scroll pagination, bottom sheets) are
  still outstanding, as is everything from Stage 3 onward.
- **Handoff reason:** authorised task complete. `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`, owner
  `NONE`.

---

## 2026-08-05 23:04–23:40 UTC — CLAUDE-B (session 3)

- **Starting state:** resumed own work. All three repos clean, `master`, level
  with remote: backend `564b3b9`, mobile `2e63aa8`, docs `5ba0e01`. Migration
  `0020` applied, up to date. Handoff `READY_FOR_HANDOFF` / NONE. Matched the
  expected takeover state exactly. (The prompt's "take ownership as CLAUDE-A" was
  a user typo, confirmed in chat — this account is CLAUDE-B.)
- **Authorised task:** F1.1 deactivation/session hardening; then the Stage 2
  branch-authorization audit (hard gate) and Stage 2 only if the gate passes.
- **F1.1 — completed.** Audit found two gaps: the JWT strategy never checked
  `is_active` (a deactivated user's access token worked until expiry), and
  deactivation did not revoke `auth_sessions` (so a deactivate→reactivate cycle
  revived the refresh token). Fix: access tokens now carry `sid` and every
  request revalidates the session (not revoked/expired) + user (active, not
  deleted); deactivation atomically sets `is_active=false` AND revokes all the
  user's active sessions. Reactivation does not un-revoke → fresh login required.
  Tenant-safe, self-deactivation still blocked, no hard delete, audit records the
  revoked-session count but no secret. Contact normalization confirmed (email
  trim+lowercase at the DTO; phone/email change resets only its own timestamp).
  Restored `settingsprobe`'s original password hash from the pre-test backup.
- **Files changed (F1.1):** `src/common/types/auth-user.ts`,
  `src/auth/{tokens,sessions,auth}.service.ts`, `src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`,
  `src/users/user-management.service.ts`, + specs `jwt.strategy.spec.ts`,
  `sessions.service.spec.ts`, extended `user-management.service.spec.ts`.
- **Tests:** backend **32 suites / 286 tests** (was 30/266; +20). `tsc` clean.
  Live-verified the full 6-step lifecycle on :3010 (11/11): session-bound token,
  deactivation→access 401 + refresh 401, reactivation keeps old tokens 401,
  fresh login works, self-deactivation 400. Demo left clean.
- **Commits:** backend `318ea81` (pushed). Docs: this entry + handoff update.
- **Stage 2 — NOT started. The branch-authorization gate FIRED.**
  `getEffectivePermissions` unions permissions across all `UserBranch`
  assignments when no `X-Branch-Id` is present (the branch-scoped path is sound
  and validates assignment). Building delegated grants on the union would leak a
  branch-A grant company-wide. Per instruction, stopped before the migration and
  reported, with a recommended safe design (grants resolved only branch-scoped,
  excluded from the union; price endpoints must require `X-Branch-Id`).
- **Handoff reason:** F1.1 shipped green; Stage 2 blocked at the mandatory audit
  gate awaiting a user decision on the resolution approach. No schema change made.

---

## 2026-08-05 21:31–22:05 UTC — CLAUDE-B

- **Starting state:** Took over from CLAUDE-A. All three repos clean, `master`,
  level with remote: backend `ea22df1`, mobile `2d6f49b`, docs `63b4657`.
  Migration `0019` applied, `migrate status` up to date, no `prisma_*` temp DBs.
  Live data reconciled against the handoff with **zero discrepancies** (6 users,
  5 active / 1 inactive `settingsprobe`; assignments owner 4, store_employee 7;
  sole login identifier `login`, unique `(company_id, login)`; no phone/email).
- **Authorised task:** (1) Make the shared handoff protocol enforceable in every
  `CLAUDE.md`. (2) Execute **F1 Stage 1 only** — contactable user foundation.
- **Work completed:**
  - Added the enforceable-protocol fields (read recent SESSION_LOG; take
    ownership only when `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`; record Owner/`started_at_utc`/all
    three HEADs/phase-scope at start; `READY_FOR_HANDOFF` only when clean+pushed)
    to all three `CLAUDE.md` within the existing markers — no duplicated section,
    canonical files still only in erp-docs.
  - Schema `0020_user_contact_fields`: nullable `phone` (E.164), `email`,
    `phoneVerifiedAt`, `emailVerifiedAt` + `@@unique([companyId, phone])`.
    Generated with `migrate diff` (schema-to-schema, no shadow DB — the migrator
    is denied on `phonestore_shadow`) and applied with `migrate deploy`.
  - Owner-only Users API (`GET/GET:id/PATCH /v1/users`, `user.manage`,
    tenant-scoped, no hash exposure, derived status, contact-change resets
    verification, no hard delete, no self-deactivation, no role field).
  - Mobile Team screen (EN/AR, RTL, permission-gated; status colour+words; edit
    sheet; no invite/OTP/passcode buttons) + `user` status registry entry.
- **Decisions made by the user:** account label CLAUDE-B; execute Stage 1 only,
  then stop. **Decisions taken by CLAUDE-B (unspecified in docs/23):** email not
  unique in Stage 1; `pending_contact` derived not stored; E.164 without
  `libphonenumber`. Recorded in `docs/23` Stage 1 and the handoff.
- **Files changed:** docs — `CLAUDE.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`,
  `docs/23`. Backend — `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/0020_*`,
  `src/users/{users.controller,user-management.service,contact.util}.ts`,
  `src/users/dto/update-user.dto.ts`, two specs, `users.module.ts`. Mobile —
  `app/team.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/more.tsx`, `types/api.ts`, `lib/query-keys.ts`,
  `lib/design/status.ts`, `lib/i18n/{en,ar}.ts`.
- **Database migrations:** `0020_user_contact_fields` applied via `migrate deploy`.
  Fresh `--hex-blob` backup taken and verified first:
  `~/erp-backups/phonestore-20260805-213342.sql` (178 854 bytes, trailer present,
  0 raw `_binary`). Post-migration: 6/6 users preserved, assignments intact,
  index NON_UNIQUE=0. No `prisma migrate reset`; no temp DB created.
- **Tests and results:** backend `npx jest` **30 suites / 266 tests** (was 28/235;
  +31). Backend `tsc` clean, mobile `tsc` clean, `expo lint` clean.
- **Live verification:** against the running backend on :3010 (shared DB,
  reversible). No-token 401; owner 200 with 6 users and no hashes; phone
  normalized to E.164 with `phoneVerifiedAt` null; duplicate 409; invalid 400;
  self-deactivation 400; revert to null; employee `store_employee` GET/PATCH 403.
  Demo left clean (0 phones; `settingsprobe` restored to `is_active=0`). Net demo
  change: +6 append-only `audit_logs` rows and `settingsprobe`'s password reset.
- **Commits:** backend `5638a52`, `1991a01`, `564b3b9`; mobile `89466ed`,
  `2e63aa8`; docs `60f718c` + the commit carrying this entry.
- **Push status:** all pushed; all three level with `origin/master`.
- **Remaining work:** F1 Stages 2–8 unstarted (per-user grants, device identity,
  OTP/WhatsApp, invitations, passcode/biometrics, Users CRUD incl. role
  assignment, auditing/rate-limits). Real-device verification of the Team screen
  (camera not involved; RTL/haptics/scroll) still outstanding, as for all screens.
- **Handoff reason:** Stage 1 complete and verified; Stage 2 was explicitly out
  of scope. Status set `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`, active account `NONE`.

---

## 2026-08-05 21:05 — CLAUDE-A

- **Starting state:** All three repositories clean, on `master`, level with
  their remotes: backend `0940b41`, mobile `d9edbed`, documentation `641b787`.
  No uncommitted or untracked files anywhere. No temporary databases.
- **Authorised task:** Bootstrap a durable two-account handoff protocol.
  Coordination files and Git commits only — explicitly **no product feature
  work**.
- **Work completed:**
  - Discovered the three repositories and their remotes; identified the
    documentation repository as the **workspace root** (`erp-docs`), with
    `backend/` and `mobile/` nested inside its working tree but excluded by its
    `.gitignore` and tracked as separate repositories.
  - Verified the baseline from evidence rather than from the prior report:
    tests, both typechecks, lint, migration status, role and permission counts,
    demo-data counts, temporary databases, backups.
  - Rewrote `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` into the shared protocol structure, preserving
    the valid content of the previous version.
  - Added the marker-enclosed shared protocol section to `CLAUDE.md` in all
    three repositories. `backend/CLAUDE.md` and `mobile/CLAUDE.md` did not
    exist and were created; the root `CLAUDE.md` was extended, not overwritten.
  - Recorded six corrections where reported state differed from actual state
    (appendix of `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`).
- **Decisions made by the user:** Account label for this workspace is
  `CLAUDE-A`. The other account may continue at the five-hour usage limit.
  Bootstrap authorises coordination files and commits only.
- **Files changed:** `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
  (documentation repo); `CLAUDE.md` (backend, new); `CLAUDE.md` (mobile, new).
  No source file, schema file or migration was touched.
- **Database migrations:** None applied. Status inspected only:
  `prisma migrate status` → *"Database schema is up to date!"*, 18 migrations,
  latest `0019_settings_foundation`.
- **Tests and results:** Backend `npx jest` → **28 suites / 235 tests passing**.
  Backend `tsc --noEmit` clean. Mobile `tsc --noEmit` clean. `expo lint` clean.
- **Live verification:** None performed in this session — no behaviour changed.
  The Settings API and screen verification from earlier on 2026-08-05 still
  stands and is recorded in `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`.
- **Commits:** backend **`ea22df1`** · mobile **`2d6f49b`** · documentation:
  *current HEAD contains this handoff* (see the note below).
- **Push status:** All three pushed to `origin/master`; all three level with
  their remotes afterwards.
- **Remaining work:** None for this task. No feature work was started, by
  instruction.
- **Handoff reason:** Bootstrap complete. Status set to `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`,
  active account `NONE`, awaiting an explicit user instruction.

*Note on the documentation commit hash: a file cannot contain the id of the
commit that introduces it, and adding a follow-up commit merely to record the
previous one creates an endless self-referential chain. The documentation
repository therefore records **"current HEAD contains this handoff"**; the
authoritative value is always `git -C <docs repo> log --oneline -1`. Backend
and mobile hashes are recorded exactly because they are committed first.*

## 2026-08-05 — E.1 backup hardening · E.2 withdrawn · F0 audit
**Owner:** Claude Opus 5 (agent session)
**Heads:** docs `307c453`, `125b798`, `fcb6e93`, + this entry · backend `0940b41` · mobile `d9edbed` (unchanged — E.2 shipped no code)

### E.1 — `--hex-blob` is now mandatory

The canonical `mysqldump` command gained `--hex-blob`, keeping
`--single-transaction --routines --triggers --events --no-tablespaces`.

Every id in this database is a `BINARY(16)` UUIDv7. Without the flag those are
written as raw bytes and **the dump file is not valid UTF-8**, so any ordinary
text tool that touches it silently replaces every primary key with `U+FFFD` —
the restore then succeeds and the damage only appears later as rows that no
longer join.

Proven on `phonestore-20260805-203646.sql` (178 854 bytes):

- 0 raw `_binary` literals, 1430 `0x…` literals, whole file survives a UTF-8
  round trip (the previous dump did not).
- Original still fails for the migrator with `ERROR 1227` — the DEFINER problem
  is untouched by `--hex-blob`, which is why the sanitiser still runs.
- Sanitised copy restored as the least-privileged migrator: **48/48 tables,
  2/2 triggers byte-identical, 12 representative row counts equal, `HEX(id)`
  checksums equal, `CHECKSUM TABLE` equal across all 48 tables**, Arabic text
  and en-dashes intact.
- Audit protection still executes: `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `audit_logs` as
  `phonestore_app` both rejected with `ERROR 1644 (45000)`; 77 rows before and
  after.
- Temp database dropped, sanitised copy deleted, original never modified.

Sanitiser kept on `latin1` deliberately: legacy dumps still need byte-exact
handling, and `DEFINER=` can legitimately appear inside row data. Four new
tests cover the hex shape; 13 total, all green.

### E.2 — withdrawn: there was no BottomSheet bug

The previous session reported that `BottomSheet` never animates in on Expo web,
sitting at `translateY(720)` with the backdrop at `opacity: 0`.

**That was a measurement artifact.** In the automated browser pane
`document.visibilityState === 'hidden'` and a `requestAnimationFrame` loop
delivers **0 frames**. Reanimated drives web animations from rAF, so every
animation in the app is frozen at its initial value there — and those initial
values are exactly `screenHeight` and `0`, the two numbers reported as the bug.

An intermediate reading that appeared to show a fix was also unsound: the DOM
selector was matching an unrelated element.

**No change was shipped.** Speculative edits were reverted: the sheet is the
surface every picker, scanner and confirmation sits on, nothing was proven
broken, and there is no device or emulator here to check native behaviour
against. The false claim was removed from `docs/21`.

*Lesson worth keeping: before diagnosing an animation, confirm the page is
animating at all.*

### F0 — Users / auth / device-security audit (read-only)

No schema, API or screen touched. Written up in
[`docs/23`](docs/23_USERS_AUTH_AUDIT_AND_PLAN.md) with a dependency-ordered F1
plan in eight stages.

Headline findings:

- **Reusable and better than expected:** Argon2id throughout, rotating refresh
  tokens *with reuse detection that revokes the session*, per-device
  `auth_sessions`, permissions resolved from the database on every request (no
  roles in the JWT), and multi-branch membership with a role per branch.
- **`User` has no phone, no email and no verification state** — the OTP and
  recovery rules have nothing to attach to yet.
- **No per-user permission grant exists**, so "per-user price editing is
  Owner-delegated" is currently impossible to express.
- **`deviceId` is client-supplied, optional and never verified**, and the mobile
  client never sends it — so "new device" is not detectable today.
- **No OTP, invitation, passcode, biometric or recovery code exists at all.**
- **`login`/`logout` audit actions exist in the enum and are never written.**
- Rate limiting is per-IP only; there is no per-account lockout.
- The company auto-lock maximum **is** done (0019) and needs no rework.

### Documentation

- `docs/22` — `--hex-blob` section, revised sanitiser rationale, new drill record.
- `docs/21` — BottomSheet claim withdrawn with the evidence.
- `docs/23` — new: F0 audit + F1 plan.
- `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` — new; neither existed, and `CLAUDE.md`
  defines no handoff protocol.
